/**
 *
 * Basic Touch Keyboard
 *
 * What you need:
 * - Basic software environment (VSC, PlatformIO)
 * - Basic hardware requirements (ESP32, USB-Cable, Jumper Wires)
 *
 *
 * This sketch transforms the ESP32 into a bluetooth keyboard.
 * You can connect to your computer and use the touch pins to
 * send keyboard commands.
 *
 * The sketch is based on the BleKeyboard library,
 * make sure the platformio.ini contains includes this library,
 * then you can use it in your sketch.
 *
 *

 * Read more about this Bluetooth Keyboard library 
 * and key you can trigger here:
